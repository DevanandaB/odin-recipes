        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water until cooked, about 8 to 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Cook the beef on the stove for about 5-8 minutes and discard the grease. </li>
        <li>Transfer the beef to a bowl and mix in the spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <li>Prepare the baking dish, then spread 1/2 of the butter slices and spread 1/2 of the pasta into the dish.</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Cover with remaining spaghetti and top with remaining slices of butter.</li>
        <li>Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese on top and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
